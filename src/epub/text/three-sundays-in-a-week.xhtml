			<h2 epub:type="title">Three Sundays in a Week</h2>
			<p>“You hardheaded, dunder-headed, obstinate, rusty, crusty, musty, fusty, old savage!” said I, in fancy, one afternoon, to my grand uncle Rumgudgeon⁠—shaking my fist at him in imagination.</p>
			<p>Only in imagination. The fact is, some trivial discrepancy <em>did</em> exist, just then, between what I said and what I had not the courage to say⁠—between what I did and what I had half a mind to do.</p>
			<p>The old porpoise, as I opened the drawing-room door, was sitting with his feet upon the mantelpiece, and a bumper of port in his paw, making strenuous efforts to accomplish the ditty.</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song" xml:lang="fr">
				<p>
					<span>Remplis ton verre vide!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vide ton verre plein!</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>“My <em>dear</em> uncle,” said I, closing the door gently, and approaching him with the blandest of smiles, “you are always so <em>very</em> kind and considerate, and have evinced your benevolence in so many⁠—so <em>very</em> many ways⁠—that⁠—that I feel I have only to suggest this little point to you once more to make sure of your full acquiescence.”</p>
			<p>“Hem!” said he, “good boy! go on!”</p>
			<p>“I am sure, my dearest uncle [you confounded old rascal!], that you have no design really, seriously, to oppose my union with Kate. This is merely a joke of yours, I know⁠—ha! ha! ha!⁠—how <em>very</em> pleasant you are at times.”</p>
			<p>“Ha! ha! ha!” said he, “curse you! yes!”</p>
			<p>“To be sure⁠—of course! I <em>knew</em> you were jesting. Now, uncle, all that Kate and myself wish at present, is that you would oblige us with your advice as⁠—as regards the <em>time</em>⁠—<em>you</em> know, uncle⁠—in short, when will it be most convenient for yourself, that the wedding shall⁠—shall⁠—come off, you know?”</p>
			<p>“Come off, you scoundrel!⁠—what do you mean by that?⁠—Better wait till it goes on.”</p>
			<p>“Ha! ha! ha!⁠—he! he! he!⁠—hi! hi! hi!⁠—ho! ho! ho!⁠—hu! hu! hu!⁠—oh, that’s good!⁠—oh, that’s capital⁠—<em>such</em> a wit! But all we want just <em>now</em>, you know, uncle, is that you would indicate the time precisely.”</p>
			<p>“Ah!⁠—precisely?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, uncle⁠—that is, if it would be quite agreeable to yourself.”</p>
			<p>“Wouldn’t it answer, Bobby, if I were to leave it at random⁠—some time within a year or so, for example?⁠—<em>must</em> I say precisely?”</p>
			<p>“<em>If</em> you please, uncle⁠—precisely.”</p>
			<p>“Well, then, Bobby, my boy⁠—you’re a fine fellow, aren’t you?⁠—since you <em>will</em> have the exact time I’ll⁠—why I’ll oblige you for once.”</p>
			<p>“Dear uncle!”</p>
			<p>“Hush, sir!” [drowning my voice]⁠—“I’ll oblige you for once. You shall have my consent⁠—and the <em>plum</em>, we mus’n’t forget the plum⁠—let me see! when shall it be? Today’s Sunday⁠—isn’t it? Well, then, you shall be married precisely⁠—<em>precisely</em>, now mind!⁠—<em>when three Sundays come together in a week</em>! Do you hear me, sir! <em>What</em> are you gaping at? I say, you shall have Kate and her plum when three Sundays come together in a week⁠—but not <em>till</em> then⁠—you young scapegrace⁠—not <em>till</em> then, if I die for it. You know me⁠—<em>I’m a man of my word</em>⁠—now be off!” Here he swallowed his bumper of port, while I rushed from the room in despair.</p>
			<p>A very “fine old English gentleman,” was my granduncle Rumgudgeon, but unlike him of the song, he had his weak points. He was a little, pursy, pompous, passionate semicircular somebody, with a red nose, a thick skull, a long purse, and a strong sense of his own consequence. With the best heart in the world, he contrived, through a predominant whim of <em>contradiction</em>, to earn for himself, among those who only knew him superficially, the character of a curmudgeon. Like many excellent people, he seemed possessed with a spirit of <em>tantalization</em>, which might easily, at a casual glance, have been mistaken for malevolence. To every request, a positive “No!” was his immediate answer; but in the end⁠—in the long, long end⁠—there were exceedingly few requests which he refused. Against all attacks upon his purse he made the most sturdy defence; but the amount extorted from him, at last, was generally in direct ratio with the length of the siege and the stubbornness of the resistance. In charity no one gave more liberally or with a worse grace.</p>
			<p>For the fine arts, and especially for the belles-lettres, he entertained a profound contempt. With this he had been inspired by Casimir Perier, whose pert little query “<q xml:lang="fr">À quoi un poète est il bon?</q>” he was in the habit of quoting, with a very droll pronunciation, as the ne plus ultra of logical wit. Thus my own inkling for the Muses had excited his entire displeasure. He assured me one day, when I asked him for a new copy of Horace, that the translation of “<i xml:lang="la">Poeta nascitur non fit</i>” was “a nasty poet for nothing fit”⁠—a remark which I took in high dudgeon. His repugnance to “the humanities” had, also, much increased of late, by an accidental bias in favor of what he supposed to be natural science. Somebody had accosted him in the street, mistaking him for no less a personage than Doctor Dubble <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">L.</abbr> Dee, the lecturer upon quack physics. This set him off at a tangent; and just at the epoch of this story⁠—for story it is getting to be after all⁠—my granduncle Rumgudgeon was accessible and pacific only upon points which happened to chime in with the caprioles of the hobby he was riding. For the rest, he laughed with his arms and legs, and his politics were stubborn and easily understood. He thought, with Horsley, that “the people have nothing to do with the laws but to obey them.”</p>
			<p>I had lived with the old gentleman all my life. My parents, in dying, had bequeathed me to him as a rich legacy. I believe the old villain loved me as his own child⁠—nearly if not quite as well as he loved Kate⁠—but it was a dog’s existence that he led me, after all. From my first year until my fifth, he obliged me with very regular floggings. From five to fifteen, he threatened me, hourly, with the House of Correction. From fifteen to twenty, not a day passed in which he did not promise to cut me off with a shilling. I was a sad dog, it is true⁠—but then it was a part of my nature⁠—a point of my faith. In Kate, however, I had a firm friend, and I knew it. She was a good girl, and told me very sweetly that I might have her (plum and all) whenever I could badger my granduncle Rumgudgeon, into the necessary consent. Poor girl!⁠—she was barely fifteen, and without this consent, her little amount in the funds was not come-at-able until five immeasurable summers had “dragged their slow length along.” What, then, to do? At fifteen, or even at twenty-one (for I had now passed my fifth olympiad) five years in prospect are very much the same as five hundred. In vain we besieged the old gentleman with importunities. Here was a pièce de résistance (as Messieurs Ude and Careme would say) which suited his perverse fancy to a T. It would have stiffed the indignation of Job himself, to see how much like an old mouser he behaved to us two poor wretched little mice. In his heart he wished for nothing more ardently than our union. He had made up his mind to this all along. In fact, he would have given ten thousand pounds from his own pocket (Kate’s plum was <em>her own</em>) if he could have invented anything like an excuse for complying with our very natural wishes. But then we had been so imprudent as to broach the subject <em>ourselves</em>. Not to oppose it under such circumstances, I sincerely believe, was not in his power.</p>
			<p>I have said already that he had his weak points; but in speaking of these, I must not be understood as referring to his obstinacy: which was one of his strong points⁠—“<i xml:lang="fr">assurement ce n’était pas sa foible.</i>” When I mention his weakness I have allusion to a <em>bizarre</em> old-womanish superstition which beset him. He was great in dreams, portents, et id genus omne of rigmarole. He was excessively punctilious, too, upon small points of honor, and, after his own fashion, was a man of his word, beyond doubt. This was, in fact, one of his hobbies. The <em>spirit</em> of his vows he made no scruple of setting at naught, but the <em>letter</em> was a bond inviolable. Now it was this latter peculiarity in his disposition, of which Kate’s ingenuity enabled us one fine day, not long after our interview in the dining-room, to take a very unexpected advantage, and, having thus, in the fashion of all modern bards and orators, exhausted in prolegomena, all the time at my command, and nearly all the room at my disposal, I will sum up in a few words what constitutes the whole pith of the story.</p>
			<p>It happened then⁠—so the Fates ordered it⁠—that among the naval acquaintances of my betrothed, were two gentlemen who had just set foot upon the shores of England, after a year’s absence, each, in foreign travel. In company with these gentlemen, my cousin and I, preconcertedly paid uncle Rumgudgeon a visit on the afternoon of Sunday, October the tenth⁠—just three weeks after the memorable decision which had so cruelly defeated our hopes. For about half an hour the conversation ran upon ordinary topics, but at last, we contrived, quite naturally, to give it the following turn:</p>
